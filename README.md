# ShipDetection

The purpose of this project is detecting ships on satellite imagery or photograms. 

During this project I found 3 different methods to solve the task:
    
    * slide-window algorithm; 
    * yolov8x algorithm; 
    * ArcGis Pro methods to solve this task; 

As a bonus I've implemented a method for detecting ships on SAR imagery using ArcGis Pro way. 

I hope this repository will give you the answers you are looking for, if not don't hesitate to contact me @ tiperciuc.radu@gmail.com for any questions about this project.
